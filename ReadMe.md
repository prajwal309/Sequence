To do:
---> Add Gridlox games logo for now. 
---> Write function to check if a position is winning or not.
---> The bottom row is not clickable. Why?



Add to the game itself:
---> Make sure the cards are replaced. 
---> Make sure two players can play with one another. How do you do this in in the same browser i.e. combine two players.
---> Check this for two players
