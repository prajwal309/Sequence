    <h2>Team Play</h2>
    <p>For 2 teams: Players must be evenly divided into two teams. Team members must alternate seats with opponents around the game board.</p>
    <p>For 3 teams: Players must be evenly divided into three teams. Team members must alternate seats with alternate seats every third player around the game board.</p>
    <p>In team play, coaching is strictly forbidden. If a teammate says anything that alerts a fellow teammate to the fact that they are about to do something they shouldn't, every member of that team must forfeit one card of their choice from their hand and place it on the discard pile.</p>

    <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
    <p>Play continues until one player or team scores the required number of SEQUENCES, at which point that player or team wins the game. If required to complete two SEQUENCES to win, players may only use one space from their first SEQUENCE as part of their second.</p>

    <h2>Object of the Game</h2>
    <p>Be the first player (or team) to score the appropriate number of SEQUENCES, one or two depending on the number of players.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Players or 2 Teams: 2 SEQUENCES</li>
        <li>3 Players or 3 Teams: 1 SEQUENCE</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>SEQUENCE:</strong> A connected series of five of the same color marker chip in a straight line, either up and down, across, or diagonally on the game board.</p>

    <h2>The Jacks</h2>
    <p>There are eight Jacks in the card deck:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The four two-eyed Jacks are wild cards. To play a two-eyed Jack, players add it to their discard pile and place one of their color marker chips on any open space on the game board.</li>
        <li>The four one-eyed Jacks are anti-wild. To play a one-eyed Jack, players add it to their opponent's marker chips (that is not already a part of a completed SEQUENCE) from the game board.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If a Jack is played, players redraw a replacement card and their turn is over.</p>

    <h2>Cards are dealt by number of players</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Players: 7 cards each</li>
            <li>3-4 Players: 6 cards each</li>
            <li>6 Players: 5 cards each</li>
        </ul>
